# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This Python-based game allows you to play the classic Hangman word guessing game. The project is designed with classes for a clear and organized structure.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run the game by executing the `hangman.py` script.

## Game Rules

- You have 6 lives to guess the correct word.
- Enter a single alphabetical character as your guess.
- The game displays the current state of the word with blanks for unrevealed letters.
- Non-alphabetic characters are represented by hyphens.
- Duplicate guesses or invalid inputs are not allowed.

## Project Structure

- `hangman.py`: Contains the main game logic.
- `visuals.py`: Provides ASCII art visuals for the hangman stages.
- `words.txt`: A file containing a list of English words used in the game. The file is sourced from [dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).
